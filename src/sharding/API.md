# Sharding API contract

## Scope and versioning

The normative sharding behavior is specified in `include/sharding/sharding_api_contract.h`; that header states its contracts are stable within v1.x. Its contract and the actual declaration being changed take precedence over this summary.

## Public contract groups

- **Routing:** stable key mapping for an unchanged ring; bounded fallback to the next shard(s), then `SHARD_UNAVAILABLE` when exhausted.
- **Distributed transactions:** participants record prepare state before voting; commit/abort are idempotent; unresolved `IN_DOUBT` work blocks conflicting writes.
- **WAL:** ordered, durable append/replay contract; checksum corruption halts replay with `WAL_CORRUPTION`.
- **Migration:** explicit state transitions, conflict rejection, and rollback/fault reporting for incomplete work.
- **Router calls:** `ShardRouter` accepts resolver/executor dependencies and exposes point operations; `ShardResult.success` must be checked before consuming its data.

## Caller and maintainer obligations

- Do not bypass the bounded fallback or reinterpret exhausted routing as success.
- Do not resolve an uncertain transaction without its coordinator/recovery path.
- Preserve canonical error codes and versioning rules in the contract header.
- Test the changed contract in `tests/sharding/test_sharding_contract_hardening_focused.cpp` or the closest focused suite registered in `tests/sharding/CMakeLists.txt`.

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for source mapping and `MODULE_GUIDE.md` for the change workflow.
