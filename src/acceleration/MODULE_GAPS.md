## ✅ Recent Remediation (2026-05-26 — compute-capability probe reliability)

- `src/acceleration/cuda/tensor_core_matmul.cu::launchINT8MatmulKernel()` now checks both
  `cudaDeviceGetAttribute` calls used to derive SM major/minor capability before deciding whether
  INT8 Tensor Cores are available. Failed attribute probes now follow the existing fallback
  return path instead of computing support from incomplete device metadata.
