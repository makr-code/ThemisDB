## ✅ Recent Remediation (2026-05-19)

- Removed token-value logging from:
  - `src/server/auth_middleware.cpp` (`AuthMiddleware::authorize`)
  - `src/server/http_server.cpp` (`HttpServer::handlePiiDeleteByUuid`)
- Removed Authorization header value logging and temporary `[AUTH-DBG]` stderr diagnostics from `src/server/http_server.cpp` (`HttpServer::requireAccess`).
- Security impact: avoids leaking bearer token fragments into logs (CWE-532 hardening).
- Related test coverage: `tests/test_auth_middleware.cpp` (`AuthMiddlewareGap013Test.DeniedReason_DoesNotEchoPresentedToken`).
